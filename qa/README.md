# QA bot-testers (dev-only)

Not part of the game runtime (still exactly `index.html` / `style.css` /
`game.js`). Plain Node ES modules driving the Playwright install already on
the machine — no `package.json`, no build step.

```bash
node qa/run-all.mjs        # everything below, exit 1 on any failure
node qa/edge-cases.mjs     # broken saves, private mode, monkey taps, pause/resize spam, XSS, clock rollback, hostile links
node qa/features.mjs       # audio, every ad placement (demo + mocked native IAP), revive, share card, challenge links, GDPR, save seal
node qa/arena-bots.mjs 20  # a 20-round Arena career: greedy/random/afk players, difficulty curve, economy, frame budget
node qa/campaign-bots.mjs 22  # greedy bot plays the first N campaign missions in virtual time
node qa/screens.mjs        # phone-size screenshots of the v11 screens -> qa/out/screens/
```

The bots tick `game.update()` in **virtual time** (RAF loop detached,
`performance.now` advanced per simulated frame), so a 2-minute round runs in
well under a second. Results and screenshots land in `qa/out/` (git-ignored).
Headless Chromium renders in software, so absolute render times are
pessimistic; the perf gate checks the low-end quality level the in-game
frame watchdog falls back to.
